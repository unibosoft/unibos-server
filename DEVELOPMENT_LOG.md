- Result: Cards now stack properly without screen overflow


## [2025-08-13 15:30] Bug Fix: Fixed Solitaire Card Stacking Spacing Issue
- Identified and resolved critical CSS/JavaScript conflict causing cards to display with full height gaps instead of Microsoft Solitaire's tight 2px/18px spacing. The issue was caused by conflicting CSS rules with \!important declarations that were overriding JavaScript positioning calculations. These CSS rules incorrectly assumed fixed positions based on row numbers rather than dynamic positioning based on card states (face-up vs face-down).
- Result: Completely rewrote solitaire.html template (v3.0) removing all conflicting CSS positioning rules, letting JavaScript have full control over card positioning. Cards now properly stack with 2px spacing for face-down and 18px for face-up cards, exactly matching Microsoft Solitaire.
