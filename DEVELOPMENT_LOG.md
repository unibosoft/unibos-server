- Result: Cards now display correctly with 7 face-up cards at tableau tops and 21 face-down cards below. Gray unicorn card backs show for face-down cards as intended.


## [2025-08-19 19:37] Bug Fix: Fixed Solitaire card initialization
- Corrected the new_game function to properly set only the top card of each tableau pile as face-up. Previously all cards were showing face-down due to incorrect initialization logic.
- Result: Now correctly shows 7 face-up cards (tableau tops) and 21 face-down cards (hidden tableau cards), matching standard Solitaire rules.


## [2025-08-19 20:10] Bug Fix: Fixed Solitaire face-up/face-down card display
- Fixed persistent issue where all cards were showing as face-down. Added force logic in both backend view and frontend JavaScript to ensure top cards of each tableau pile are always face-up. Also replaced browser confirm dialog with custom UNIBOS-themed popup for new game confirmation.
- Result: Cards now display correctly with top cards face-up and hidden cards face-down. New game uses custom popup matching UNIBOS theme.


## [2025-08-19 20:17] Bug Fix: Fixed Solitaire game state persistence
- Fixed issue where game was not resuming from saved state when returning to Solitaire. Improved session management to properly find and load existing game sessions.

- Result: Cards now render properly and game is playable again.


## [2025-08-19 20:30] Database: Setup data_db directory and screen lock
- Created /data_db directory structure for user data and PostgreSQL backups. Added screen lock code 'lplp' to database for admin user. Created structure SQL dump and data backup. All data files are git-ignored for security.
- Result: /data_db directory ready. Screen lock code 'lplp' working for solitaire exit.


## [2025-08-20 01:47] Bug Fix: Solitaire Card Dealing Fixed
- Fixed critical issue where cards were not displaying in solitaire game. Root cause was duplicate game state creation in JavaScript that was overwriting backend data. Removed 70+ lines of redundant game creation logic from initGame() and fixed createNewGameLocal() to properly use backend responses. Also fixed web_ui/views.py to pass game_state and session_id to template context.
- Result: Cards now display immediately on load, new game button works properly, and game state persists correctly


## [2025-08-23 10:22] Bug Fix: Solitaire Admin Dashboard Fixes
